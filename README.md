### Hi I'm Christina ðŸ‘‹ and I'm a star ðŸŒŸ 

... at least this is what my surname implies ðŸ˜Š.
I'm a molecular biologist and university lecturer who is passionate about big data and AI in the life sciences. I have set out to become a biomedical data scientist because I am convinced that data will be driving biomedical discoveries and how we think about diseases, develop drugs or inform treatment choices even more in the future. My credo is *"you are never too old to set another goal and dream another dream"* which keeps me curious and motivated to learn new skills such as coding or playing the violin. 

ðŸ”­ I'm interested in collaborating on biological/biomedical or healthcare data problems.
